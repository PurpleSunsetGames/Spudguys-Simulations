                The name "The Spudguy" is, in fact, not at all related to anything on this website. 
                When I started my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvTG5WK84fFZVqSPt5fXdXQ" target="_blank" title="The Spudguy">YouTube channel</a>, 
                I was obsessed with the game Scrap Mechanic, and since the main weapons in that game are spudguns, 
                I figured the name was appropriate. Now, my channel centers around <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator" target="_blank" title="Desmos | Graphing Calculator">Desmos</a>, computer programming, 
                and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBFFThDgTrc" target="_blank">music</a>. 
                <br>
                The point of this website isn't to talk about my channel, though! It's to act as my portfolio, showing off what I've been doing recently in the world
                of computer programming. On the home page, you can find a few of the GPU-based web applications that I've worked on. Soon, I will include some of my most technical
                Desmos graphs (such as <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/x8uypo3sfh" target="_blank" title="May take a while to load!">this one</a> or the one animated to the <a>right</a>) 
                and explanations on how I made them. I also do 3D <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrl4epCS5KI" target="_blank" title="Spoon Pro">animations</a> and <a href="./thumbnails/sunsetpurpforest.png" title="Purple Forest" target="_blank">renders</a>
